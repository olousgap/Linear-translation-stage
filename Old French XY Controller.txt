Old French XY Controller
04-03-2002 09:07 AM 

I have built a Light Beam Induced Current cum I-V
characterisation setup in which data acquisition from
typical 400K pixel scans takes about 100 hours. This
acquisition is effected over a PCMCIA/GPIB interface
by LabVIEW 6.0 running on Windows 2000.

The single largest contributor to the total data
acquisition time is XY-scanning. The instrument in
question is a French fabrication XY Controller of
the type

Micro Controle Model IT6D CA2

which employs micron-precision step motors. I have
been unable to find any drivers for this instrument
as it is rather old and, to the best of my knowledge,
unsupported. I currently use a core which appears to
work though its intricacies are not clear to either
myself or others I have asked.

Does anyone have a
ny experience that may be
relevant to this XY Controller? General tips on
improving the efficiency of XY Controllers in
LabVIEW would be greatly appreciated.

PS
Many thanks to Dennis Knutson for supplying an
invaluable pointer - and sample VI to boot - on the
issue of using the HP6632A as a variable DC voltage
source. I had grappled with the notion of a Shift
Register, but proved too much of a LabVIEW newbie
when it came to the implementation.

Hi Andrew,

Can you chase down the command documentation for the microsteppers? gpib is rather straight-forward in LV.

Hello,

 

I have the same problem than andreww, does anyone have a solution? Does anyone know gpib commands to pilote a Micro-Controle IT6DCA?

Thanks,

I've finally found the solution. For the axis 1:

    I1=+XXXX! :to move the axis of XXXXpoints.

    I1O to go back to zero (O the letter)

    I1? to ask the state of the axis 1.

    C1O et C1? for the face.

the same commandes with 2 instead of 1 for the second motor

 

Possible answers are AR1 (:move finished) DE1 (move) RO1(go back to zero) and  F-1/F+1 (end stop)

The commands must finish with a LF procedure.
